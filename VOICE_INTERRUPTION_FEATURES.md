# Voice Interruption Features - EchoDay

## Overview
The ChatModal now includes advanced voice interruption features that allow users to naturally interrupt the AI while it's speaking, just like in a real conversation.

## Key Features

### 1. **User Interruption Detection**
- When the user starts speaking while AI is talking, the system **automatically stops the AI** immediately
- Visual feedback shows "Kesildi" (Interrupted) status when this happens
- The system is smart enough to detect when you're actively speaking

### 2. **Voice Stop Commands**
Users can say any of these commands to stop the AI from speaking:
- **"sus"** - Stop
- **"dur"** - Stop
- **"stop"** - Stop
- **"kapat"** - Close/Stop
- **"sustun"** - You stopped
- **"tamam dur"** - Okay stop
- **"yeter"** - Enough

When any of these commands are detected:
- AI speech stops immediately
- The stop command is NOT sent as a message to the AI
- The system returns to listening mode

### 3. **Intelligent Listening Restart**
After AI speech ends (whether completed or interrupted):
- **If interrupted by user**: Listening restarts after **500ms** (fast)
- **If completed naturally**: Listening restarts after **1500ms** (slower)
- This creates a more natural conversation flow

### 4. **Real-time Command Processing**
- Stop commands are detected and processed **immediately** as you speak them
- No need to wait for the recognition to finish
- Commands ending with stop words trigger instant action

### 5. **Visual Feedback**
The UI provides clear feedback:
- 🔵 **"Konuşuyor..."** - AI is currently speaking
- 🟠 **"Kesildi"** - AI was interrupted by user
- 🔴 **Pulsing red mic** - User is actively speaking
- 🟢 **Green indicator** - Voice mode is active

## How to Use

### Activating Voice Mode
1. Click the **"Sesli Mod"** button in the chat header
2. Click **"🔊 Ses İzni Ver"** if prompted (required for autoplay)
3. The microphone will automatically start listening

### Interrupting AI
Simply start speaking while the AI is talking:
- The AI will **immediately stop**
- Your speech will be captured
- The conversation continues naturally

### Using Stop Commands
Say any stop command (e.g., "sus", "dur", "yeter"):
- AI stops speaking **instantly**
- The stop command is filtered out (not sent as a message)
- Listening restarts automatically

### Manual Controls
- **Microphone button**: Toggle listening on/off manually
- **Voice mode button**: Toggle entire voice mode on/off
- **"Sesli Oku" button**: Replay any AI message

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified

#### 1. **ChatModal.tsx**
- Added `wasInterrupted` state to track interruption status
- Enhanced `handleUserSpeaking` callback to detect speaking during AI speech
- Updated `handleTranscriptReady` to filter stop commands
- Modified listening restart logic to adapt delay based on interruption
- Added visual indicators for interruption status

#### 2. **useSpeechRecognition.ts**
- Added immediate stop command detection in real-time mode
- Stop commands trigger instant transcript processing
- Commands ending with stop words are captured immediately
- Improved onUserSpeaking callback reliability

### Key Logic Flow

```
User starts speaking
    ↓
Is AI currently speaking?
    ↓ Yes
Stop AI immediately
    ↓
Mark as interrupted
    ↓
Capture user's speech
    ↓
Is it a stop command?
    ↓ Yes: Filter it out
    ↓ No: Send as message to AI
    ↓
AI processes and responds
    ↓
AI speaks response
    ↓
User can interrupt or let it finish
    ↓
Listening restarts (500ms if interrupted, 1500ms if complete)
```

## Browser Compatibility

### Required Features
- **Web Speech API** (SpeechRecognition)
- **Speech Synthesis API**
- **Microphone access permission**

### Supported Browsers
✅ **Chrome/Edge** (Chromium-based) - Full support
✅ **Safari** - Full support (iOS 14.5+)
⚠️ **Firefox** - Limited support (no continuous recognition)

## Debugging

All voice interactions are logged to console:
- `🎤 User speaking state changed` - User speech detection
- `⛔ Stopping AI speech due to user interruption` - Interruption triggered
- `🛑 Stop command detected` - Stop command recognized
- `📤 Sending user message` - Message being sent to AI
- `⏱️ Scheduling listening restart` - Restart timer set
- `🎤 Auto-restarting listening` - Listening restarted

Open browser DevTools Console to see these logs during testing.

## Troubleshooting

### AI doesn't stop when I speak
- Ensure voice mode is active (green button)
- Check that microphone permission is granted
- Verify "Ses İzni Ver" button was clicked
- Make sure you're actually speaking (check for red pulsing mic)

### Stop commands not working
- Speak clearly and end your speech with the stop word
- Supported commands: "sus", "dur", "stop", "kapat", "sustun", "yeter"
- Check console for "🛑 Stop command detected" message

### Listening doesn't restart after AI speaks
- Check console logs for restart timer messages
- Verify voice mode is still active
- Try manually clicking the microphone button
- Refresh the page and reactivate voice mode

### AI speech quality issues
- Adjust speech rate in TTS settings if needed
- Ensure Turkish voice is available in your browser
- Check browser's Text-to-Speech settings

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Customizable stop commands
- Pause/resume instead of full stop
- Voice activity detection thresholds
- Multi-language stop commands
- Gesture controls for interruption
- Context-aware interruption handling

## Notes

- The system uses **Turkish (tr-TR)** language for both recognition and synthesis
- All stop commands are case-insensitive
- Interruption works best with clear, distinct speech
- Background noise may affect interruption detection
- The system filters out stop commands from being sent as messages to maintain natural flow
