# Fix for Deleted Todos Reappearing After Refresh

## Problem
Deleted todos were reappearing after page refresh because the app only removed them from local state but not from the Supabase backend. When the sync mechanism fetched data from Supabase, it would merge back the "deleted" items.

## Solution Overview
Implemented a **soft delete mechanism** that:
1. Adds an `is_deleted` boolean column to the todos table
2. Updates deletion logic to set `is_deleted=true` instead of hard deleting
3. Filters out deleted items in all fetch operations
4. Maintains data integrity and allows for potential recovery

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`database/migrations/add_soft_delete_to_todos.sql`)
- Added `is_deleted` boolean column with default `false`
- Added performance indexes on `is_deleted` and `(user_id, is_deleted)`
- Updated RLS policies to automatically filter deleted items
- Created optional `active_todos` view for clean data access

### 2. Supabase Client (`src/services/supabaseClient.ts`)
- **Added `deleteTodos()` function**: Performs soft delete by setting `is_deleted=true`
- **Updated `fetchAll()`**: Now filters out items where `is_deleted=true`
- **Updated `upsertTodos()`**: Ensures `is_deleted=false` for new/existing todos

### 3. Main Component (`src/Main.tsx`)
- **Updated `handleDeleteTodo()`**: Now calls `deleteTodos()` to sync deletion with backend
- Added error handling and user notification for sync failures
- Maintains responsive UI by updating local state immediately

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
Run the SQL migration in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Execute the contents of database/migrations/add_soft_delete_to_todos.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Database Changes
Check that:
- `is_deleted` column exists in `public.todos` table
- RLS policies are updated
- Indexes are created

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. Create a new todo
2. Delete the todo
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify the todo doesn't reappear

## Technical Details

### Soft Delete Flow
1. User clicks delete â†’ `handleDeleteTodo(id)` called
2. Todo removed from local state immediately (responsive UI)
3. `deleteTodos(userId, [id])` called to sync with backend
4. Backend sets `is_deleted=true, updated_at=now()` for the todo
5. Future fetches ignore items where `is_deleted=true`

### Benefits
- **Data Recovery**: Deleted items can be recovered if needed
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains history of all user actions
- **Performance**: Indexed queries remain fast
- **Consistency**: RLS policies ensure deleted items never appear in queries

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing todos without `is_deleted` column are treated as active (RLS policy handles NULL values)
- No data loss during migration
- App continues to work if Supabase is not configured

## Alternative: Using the Active Todos View
For cleaner code, you can optionally use the `active_todos` view:
```javascript
// Instead of filtering in application code:
supabase.from('todos').select('*').eq('user_id', userId).neq('is_deleted', true)

// Use the view (automatically filters):
supabase.from('active_todos').select('*').eq('user_id', userId)
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Database migration applied successfully
- [ ] New todos can be created
- [ ] Todos can be deleted and don't reappear after refresh
- [ ] Existing todos still work correctly
- [ ] Sync works for authenticated users
- [ ] Guest mode still works (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Error handling works when Supabase is unavailable

## Monitoring
Monitor the `is_deleted` column to understand deletion patterns:
```sql
-- Count deleted vs active todos per user
SELECT 
  user_id,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_deleted = true) as deleted_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_deleted = false OR is_deleted IS NULL) as active_count
FROM public.todos 
GROUP BY user_id;
```

This fix ensures deleted todos will never reappear and provides a robust foundation for future data management features.
